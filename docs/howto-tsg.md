We encounter several times when users say "service is not working", however we need more information in detail to find out the root cause of the "not working" issue. This guidance is to introduce several ways to help do self-diagnosis to find the root cause directly or narrow down the issue and report it to us for further investigation.

First, please check from the Azure portal which ServiceMode is the Azure SignalR Service (aka. **ASRS**) configured to.

![ServiceMode](./images/service-mode.png)

* For `Default` mode, please refer to [default mode troubleshooting](#default_mode_tsg)
* For `Serverless` mode, please refer to [serverless mode troubleshooting](#serverless_mode_tsg)
* For `Classic` mode, please refer to [classic mode troubleshooting](#classic_mode_tsg)

## Default mode troubleshooting
When **ASRS** is in *Default* mode, there are **3** roles: *Client*, *Server*, and *Service*:
* *Client*: *Client* stands for the clients connected to **ASRS**. The persistent connections connecting client and **ASRS** are called *Client Connections* in this guidance.
* *Server*: *Server* stands for the server which serves client negotiation and hosts SignalR `Hub` logic. And the persistent connections between *Server* and **ASRS** are called *Server Connections* in this guidance.
* *Service*: *Service* is the short name for **ASRS** in this guidance.

Please refer to [Internals of Azure SignalR Service](./internal.md) for the detailed introduction of the whole architecture and workflow.

When something is not working, the first thing to do is to narrow down the issue. There are several ways that can help to achieve this. 
* If the issue happens right in the way or is repro-able, the straight-forward way is to view the on-going traffic. 
* If the issue is hard to repro, traces and logs can help.

### How to view the traffic and narrow down the issue
Capturing the on-going traffic is the most straight-forward way to narrow down the issue. You can capture the [Network traces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/diagnostics#network-traces) using the options described below:

- [Collect a network trace with Fiddler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/diagnostics#network-traces)
- [Collect a network trace with tcpdump](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/diagnostics#collect-a-network-trace-with-tcpdump-macos-and-linux-only)
- [Collect a network trace in the browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/diagnostics#collect-a-network-trace-in-the-browser)

<a name="view_traffic_client"></a>

For a SignalR persistent connection, it first `/negotiate` to your hosted app server and then redirected to the Azure SignalR service and then establishes the real persistent connection to Azure SignalR service. Please refer to [Internals of Azure SignalR Service](./internal.md) for the detailed steps.

With the client side network trace in hand, check which request fails with what status code and what response, and look for solutions inside [Troubleshooting Guide](./tsg.md).

<a name="view_traffic_server"></a>

SignalR *Server* maintains the *Server Connection* between *Server* and *Service*. When the app server starts it starts the **WebSocket** connection to Azure SignalR service. All the client traffics are routed through Azure SignalR service to these *Server Connection*s and then dispatched to the `Hub`. When a *Server Connection* drops, the clients routed to this *Server Connection* will be impacted. Our Azure SignalR SDK has a "Always Retry" logic to reconnect the *Server Connection* with at most 1 minute delay to minimize the impact.

*Server Connection*s can drop due to network instability or regular maintainance of Azure SignalR Service, or your hosted app server updates/maintainance. As long as client-side has the disconnect/reconnect mechanism, the impact is minimal like any client-side caused disconnect-reconnect.

View server side network trace to find out the status code and error detail why *Server Connection* drops or is rejected by the *Service*, and look for the root cause inside [Troubleshooting Guide](./tsg.md).

### How to add logs
Logs can be really useful to diagnose issues and monitor the running status.

<a name="add_logs_client"></a>
#### How to enable client-side log
Client side logging experience is exactly the same as when using self-hosted SignalR.
<a name="add_logs_client_aspnetcore"></a>
##### Enable client side logging for `ASP.NET Core SignalR`
- [JavaScript client logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/diagnostics#javascript-client-logging)
- [.NET client logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/signalr/diagnostics#net-client-logging)

<a name="add_logs_client_aspnet"></a>
##### Enable client side logging for `ASP.NET SignalR`
- [.NET client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/testing-and-debugging/enabling-signalr-tracing#enabling-tracing-in-the-net-client-windows-desktop-apps)
- [Enabling tracing in Windows Phone 8 clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/testing-and-debugging/enabling-signalr-tracing#enabling-tracing-in-windows-phone-8-clients)
- [Enabling tracing in the JavaScript client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/testing-and-debugging/enabling-signalr-tracing#enabling-tracing-in-the-javascript-client)

<a name="add_logs_server"></a>
#### How to enable server-side log
<a name="add_logs_server_aspnetcore"></a>
##### Enable server side logging for `ASP.NET Core SignalR`
Server side logging for `ASP.NET Core SignalR` integrates with the `ILogger` based [logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=aspnetcore2x) provided in the `ASP.NET Core` framework. You can enable server side logging by using `ConfigureLogging`, a sample usage as follows:
```cs
.ConfigureLogging((hostingContext, logging) =>
        {
            logging.AddConsole();
            logging.AddDebug();
        })
```
Logger categories for Azure SignalR always starts with `Microsoft.Azure.SignalR`. To enable detailed logs from Azure SignalR, configure the preceding prefixes to `Information` level in your **appsettings.json** file like below:
```JSON
{
    "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
            ...
            "Microsoft.Azure.SignalR": "Information",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

Check if there are any abnormal warning/error logs recorded. 

<a name="add_logs_server_aspnet"></a>
##### Enable server side traces for `ASP.NET SignalR`
When using SDK version >= `1.0.0`, you can enable traces by adding the following to `web.config`: ([Details](https://github.com/Azure/azure-signalr/issues/452#issuecomment-478858102))
```xml
<system.diagnostics>
    <sources>
      <source name="Microsoft.Azure.SignalR" switchName="SignalRSwitch">
        <listeners>
          <add name="ASRS" />
        </listeners>
      </source>
    </sources>
    <!-- Sets the trace verbosity level -->
    <switches>
      <add name="SignalRSwitch" value="Information" />
    </switches>
    <!-- Specifies the trace writer for output -->
    <sharedListeners>
      <add name="ASRS" type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" initializeData="asrs.log.txt" />
    </sharedListeners>
    <trace autoflush="true" />
  </system.diagnostics>
```

Check if there are any abnormal warning/error logs recorded. 

<a name="add_logs_service"></a>
#### How to enable logs inside Azure SignalR service
You can also [enable diagnostic logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-signalr/signalr-tutorial-diagnostic-logs) for Azure SignalR service, these logs provide detailed information of every connection connected to the Azure SignalR service.

<a name="serverless_mode_tsg"></a>
## `Serverless` mode troubleshooting
When **ASRS** is in *Serverless* mode, please note that only **ASP.NET Core SignalR** supports `Serverless` mode, **ASP.NET SignalR** does **NOT** support this mode.

To diagnose connectivity issues in `Serverless` mode, the most straight forward way is to [view client side traffic](#view_traffic_client). Enable [client-side logs](#add_logs_client) and [service-side logs](#add_logs_service) can also be helpful.

<a name="classic_mode_tsg"></a>
## Classic mode troubleshooting
`Classic` mode is obsoleted and is not encouraged to use. When in this mode, Azure SignalR service uses the connected *Server Connections* to determine if current service is in `default` mode or `serverless` mode. This can lead to some intermediate client connectivity issues because, when there is a sudden drop of all the connected *Server Connection* for example due to network instability, Azure SignalR believes it is now switched to `serverless` mode, and clients connected during this period will never be routed to the hosted app server. Enable [service-side logs](#add_logs_service) and check if there are any clients recorded as `ServerlessModeEntered` if you have hosted app server howevever some clients never reach the app server side. If there is any, [abort these client connections](#TODO_Add_REST_API) and let the clients restart can help.

Troubleshooting `classic` mode connectivity and message delivary issues are similar to [troubleshooting default mode issues](#default_mode_tsg).

<a name="service_health"></a>
## Service health

You can check the health api for service health.

* Request: GET `https://{instance_name}.service.signalr.net/api/v1/health`
* Response status code:
  * 200: healthy.
  * 503: your service is unhealthy.
    You can:
    * Wait serval minutes for auto-recover.
    * Check the ip address is same as the ip from portal.
    * Or restart instance.
    
    If both not work, please contact us (add new support request in azure portal).
